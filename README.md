# rosenpass-website
Website for project Rosenpass (quantum-secure VPN key exchange)


## Information

### Google Analytics
As we use the Docsy theme with Hugo, which is produced by Google, the Docsy submodule has files relating to data gathering for Google Analytics. We have taken care to ensure that these components cannot be called in the built website.

## Website Components

### Hugo
The website is built with Hugo, which generates a static site.

**General Installation**
If you just want to serve the website locally:

Prerequisites:
Hugo (extended version), Git, Node.js

After cloning:
- `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- `npm ci`

Commands to remember: 
**Mullana (Windows)**
In Powershell 7(+) (with npm, node and chocolatey):
- npm update (after git pull)
- hugo server (serve site on localhost)
- hugo (generate static files)

**Alice**
- ...

### Whitepaper
**TODO**: The Whitepaper is currently not automatically pulled from the repo anymore. 
- it comes from https://github.com/rosenpass/rosenpass/blob/papers-pdf/whitepaper.pdf
- and goes into the website root (htdocs/rosenpass on servercow)

### Manuals
**TODO**: Manuals are are currently not automatically pulled from the repo anymore. 
- Source?
- They go into the website main branch at rosenpass\content\en\docs\manuals

### Release Notes
- **TODO**: Release notes need to be added (automatically).

## Hosting
- The website is hosted on servercow. 
- There is currently no automated rollout. You have to move the files via FTP. 
- The website runs on nginx instead of apache for security reasons, so no .htaccess etc.
- **CAUTION**: Don't delete the folders "whitepaper" and "kaffeepause", as they are not in the github repository!

## Tips and Tricks

### ...


## Getting started with Nix

### Initialising
Once nix package manager is installed:
- clone the repo (if not already)
- git submodule init (if not already)
- git submodule update

### Everyday Use

- A development shell can be started using `nix develop`. It contains NodeJS and Hugo,
plus a couple of handy commands, the list of which can be shown by invoking `menu`.
```nix develop```

- Serve the website to a localhost, usually 1313
```serve```

- Build the website, outputs to /public.
```build```

## CI/CD Pipeline
The website is built and deployed via GitHub Actions workflows. Therefore, any push to the main branch will trigger a rebuild of the website. Instead, please open a pull request for anything other than small content updates. If you are working on something larger than that, you can merge/push to the /beta branch, which will build and deploy to https://beta.rosenpass.eu where you can test your output before trying to merge into the main branch.
