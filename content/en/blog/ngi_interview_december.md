Rosenpass is proud to have partnered with the NLnet Foundation, across multiple grants,
to create and further develop our post-quantum secure cryptographic protocol and its implementation in our open source Rust software. Supported under the NGI Assure program,
our work is vital in preparing for the threat to cryptography posed by post-quantum computing. Through our commitment to free, open source, and open science work, we are able to accelerate the 
migration to a post-quantum secure internet that remains free and accessible to all who need it.

As part of this collaboration, Karolin Varner, our project lead, participated in an in-depth interview, linked below, discussing the vision and impact of Rosenpass. She shared insights into our focus on 
security, the culture of innovation and inclusivity within the project, and the role NGI Assure has played in realising Rosenpassâ€™ plans. The conversation also highlights the broader importance of 
cryptography in an ever-evolving digital landscape, as well as the steps Rosenpass is taking toward a more secure future.
