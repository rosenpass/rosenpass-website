  Welcome to the documentation page for Rosenpass! This guide contains everything you need to get started with Rosenpass as a software developer, a scientist, a potential collaborator, or as anyone looking to upgrade their security to be post-quantum secure. </p>
  <p>The content found here can be broadly split into two categories: <a href="/docs/#TheRosenpassTool">software</a> and <a href="/docs/#TheRosenpassProject">science</a>. You will find links to installation and compilation guides, versioning information, and command-line manuals, as well as to our whitepaper describing the Rosenpass protocol, presentations looking to communicate the scientific
  underpinnings of our project, and the results of a penetration test performed on our software.
</p>

<h2 class="h5">Quick Start</h2>
<p>
  If you simply want to get the Rosenpass tool up and running quickly, you are best served using our <a href="/docs/rosenpass-tool/start">Quick Start Guide</a>.
  It contains everything you need to download, configure, and start a WireGuard connection using the Rosenpass key exchange.
