## 0.2.2
- Fixes vulnerability to prevent output shared key (OSK) to be set or written again on a responder receiving the same InitConf message during a handshake.
- This release has no impact for majority of users using Rosenpass with Wireguard


## 0.2.1

- Removed unnecessary unsafe keyword instances
- Addressed stack overflow based test failure using the stacker crate
- Added fix to reap lingering wireguard child-processes
- Updated manpage

## 0.2.0

- Refined CI for pre-release vs draft vs release artifacts
- Added licensing information: MIT and Apache 2.0
