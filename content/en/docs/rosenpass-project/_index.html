introduction: "Rosenpass is a project to produce free/libre, open source, and open science cryptographic tooling to aid the migration of the 
internet's infrastructure towards post-quantum secure cryptography. Beginning life as a quantum-resistant secure key-exchange daemeon for 
WireGuard, we aim to establish our tooling as a foundational cryptographic library able to meet the security needs of the coming post-quantum 
world.


Cryptographic research is long underway on this migration towards post-quantum security. Both for standardised, broadly-implemented tools, 
such as TLS, and for small, developer-focuseed tools, such as Libsodium, WireGuard, and the Noise protocol framework. Our project currently 
focuses on engineering developer-friendly protocol libraries, hoping to better translate progression in cryptographic research into usable, 
accessible, and maintainable code.


Cryptography, as a field, uses open source as its peer review, aiming to make its solutions as accessible as possible, and thus as open to 
critique and testing as possible. As part of that work, we look to integate computational cryptographic analysis tools in our work, enabling 
developers, small and large, to engage with security tools on a more direct level.


This section contains our scientific research, as well as our work on communicating the Rosenpass protocol, the Rosenpass tool, and on broader 
cryptographic education to the free and open source community."

blerb: "Rosenpass is a project to produce free/libre, open source, and open science cryptographic tooling to aid the migration of the internet's
 infrastructure towards post-quantum secure cryptography, e.g. encryption and authentication. 
 
 
 Currently, the project consists of the Rosenpass protocol, a cryptographic analysis of its security
  using [ProVerif](https://bblanche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/proverif/), and its implementation in the Rosenpass tool. We focus our work towards better 
 integration of academic cryptography, the development of software, and its deployment in industry and infrastructure."
