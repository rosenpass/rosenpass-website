introduction: "The Rosenpass tool is a daemon, written in Rust, that implements the Rosenpass protocol to create and exchange hybridised 
post-quantum and classically secure keys between two peers. It uses two cryptographic methods, Classic McEliece and Kyber, to secure systems 
against quantum attacks. It represents one of the most advanced open-source solutions for providing post-quantum security currently available.
    

While the Rosenpass tool is written in Rust, it currently relies on libsodium and liboqs, both of which are C libraries, enabling advanced 
security features. We implement a number of techniques to ensure that the code is secure. For example, we use variable colouring (gating use of 
a secret value through a .secret() method), and the code zeroises all key material.


The Rosenpass tool works best and most natively with WireGuard. It can, however, be used to perform a stand-alone key exchange. Using this mode, 
it can secure other protocols against attacks from quantum computers. To use this mode, the rosenpass binary must be used together with the outfile <FILE> parameter. Rosenpass will write a key to the given file 
  every two minutes, and print a message on standard out to notify the user or the calling script that the key has changed.
  

This section contains links to user guides, installation guides, release notes, and other information on the Rosenpass Tool."

blerb: "The Rosenpass tool is a daemon, written in Rust, that implements the Rosenpass protocol to create and exchange hybridised post-quantum and
 classically secure keys between two peers. Using a hybrid security model allows us to preserve the reliability of battle-proven classical 
 cryptography whilst still providing the necessary upgrade to secure against decryption of data by quantum computers (i.e., protect against 
 “store-now decrypt-later attacks”).

 
The Rosenpass tool works best and most natively with [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), as it was first envisioned specifically to inject post-quantum secured keys 
into WireGuard using its Pre-Shared Key parameter. However, as the Rosenpass tool can export its shared secrets to a file, it can be implemented 
in other use cases. We were able to demonstrate its potential for integration with Transport Layer Security (TLS), in [this tutorial](/blog/tlsrosenpass_july) on using 
[OpenSSL](https://openssl.org/) with Rosenpass."

<h2>What planned features are on the way?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Cunicu integration:</b> <a href="https://cunicu.li">Cunicu</a> is a user-space daemon for managing WireGuard connections for small devices. We intend to integrate post-quantum security into that daemon via Rosenpass</li>
    <li><b>Docker and micro-VM implementations:</b> We are currently working on using micro-VMs to reduce the scope of system privileges Rosenpass needs to run</li>
    <li><b>Hacspec integration:</b> Hackspec is a rust-based language designed by <a>Cryspen</a> to enable the use of several formal verification tools that enable high-assurance cryptography</li>
    <li><b>Golang implementation of Rosenpass:</b> Our initial implementation of Rosenpass is written in Rust, but we are working on an alternative, compatible Golang-built implementation to increase diversity and reach new platforms. 	
	It is called <a href="https://github.com/cunicu/go-rosenpass">go-rosenpass</a>. 	</li>
