### Supported Systems

We provide packages for **Nix**, **Arch Linux**, and **Alpine Linux**, as well as dedicated guides for manual installation on **[Ubuntu](ubuntu)** or **[Debian](debian)**.

Since Rosenpass was released not too long ago, **packaging is an ongoing process**. You can find the latest information about all the Linux distributions we support on **[Repology](https://repology.org/project/rosenpass/versions)**.

Even if your distribution is not listed here, you can always **[compile Rosenpass yourself](linux#compile-it-from-source)** or download a pre-built, statically linked **binary** from our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/rosenpass/rosenpass/releases/latest). You can also find OCI container images (Docker, Podman, etc.) there. While we only offer x86_64 builds, there's no technical reason limiting Rosenpass to x86_64. Although we are not officially supporting it, you can try to compile Rosenpass for any architecture that is supported by [liboqs](https://openquantumsafe.org/liboqs/#overview) and running Linux (or macOS).


### How to install Rosenpass on your Linux distribution

If your distribution isn't listed below, you can install Rosenpass manually in just a few steps. We provide detailed installation instructions for **[Ubuntu](ubuntu)**, **[Debian](debian)**, **[Arch Linux](arch)**, and generic **[Linux](linux)** systems.

{{< code-block-prompt-css-class class="arch-pacman" text="Arch via pacman    # " >}}
{{< code-block-prompt-css-class class="arch-aur"    text="Arch via the AUR   $ " >}}
{{< code-block-prompt-css-class class="nixos"       text="NixOS              $ " >}}
{{< code-block-prompt-css-class class="nix-flake"   text="nix-flake          $ " >}}
{{< code-block-prompt-css-class class="alpine"      text="Alpine (testing)   $ " >}}

```sh{class="code-block-list arch-pacman"}
pacman -S rosenpass
```
```sh{class="code-block-list nixos"}
nix-env -iA nixos.rosenpass nixos.rosenpass-tools
```
```sh{class="code-block-list nix-flake"}
nix profile install github:rosenpass/rosenpass#rosenpass
```
```sh{class="code-block-list alpine"}
apk add rosenpass
```
<span class="spacer"></span>

As a quick test that the installation succeeded, run both tools with the `help` command to show a short usage hint:

```sh{class="code-block-list command-user"}
rosenpass help
```
```sh{class="code-block-list command-user"}
rp help
```
