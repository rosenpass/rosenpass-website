- You can compile Rosenpass yourself. This gives you the advantage of ensuring that you use Rosenpass as exactly as the source code is in Git.

1. Install the dependencies. Under Debian, you can do this with the following command: 

<span class="codebox">

```sh
sudo apt-get --yes install libsodium-dev libclang-dev cmake pkg-config git build-essential
```

</span>

2. If you want to use Rosenpass with WireGuard, install WireGuard. On Debian, you can do this with the following command: 

<span class="codebox">

```sh 
sudo apt-get --yes install wireguard
```
</span>

3. Install Rust >= 1.64.0 (as of 2023-07-01). This can be achieved using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/), for example.

4. Clone the Git Repository: 

<span class="codebox">

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rosenpass/rosenpass.git
```

</span>

5. Change to the Rosenpass directory: 

<span class="codebox">

```sh
cd rosenpass
```

</span>

6. Switch to the version you want to install. Without switching, you will install and compile the dev version. Find the name of the version that you would like to install on the [releases page](https://github.com/rosenpass/rosenpass/releases), or [find the name of the latest release](https://github.com/rosenpass/rosenpass/releases/latest). Use the following command to switch to version, e.g., 0.2.2: 

<span class="codebox">

```sh
git checkout v0.2.2
```

</span>

7. Compile Rosenpass, this may take a while:

<span class="codebox">

```sh
cargo build --release
```

</span>

8. Install Rosenpass: 

<span class="codebox">

```sh
sudo install target/release/rosenpass /usr/local/bin
```

</span>

9. If you want the Rosenpass helper:

<span class="codebox">

```sh
rp
```

</span>

It can be installed it with: 

<span class="codebox">

```sh
sudo install rp /usr/local/bin
```

</span>
