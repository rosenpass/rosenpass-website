# Formosa Retreat â€“ Rosenpass

- What is rosenpass?
  - Crypto: Post quantum WireGuard
    - SLIDE: Rosenpass Security Properties
  - Implementation
    - Hybrid security through interop with WG
      - SLIDE: RP/WG parallel operation
      - SLIDE: Tutorial screenshot
  - Proofs: ProVerif
    - SLIDE: ProVerif in technicolor
  - Comms:
    - Having worked in industry has some advantages
    - Digestable specifications;
      - SLIDE: Specification graphic
      - => Somebody just did a go implementation
    - Professional illustration
      - SLIDE: Hashing scheme
      - SLIDE: Mullana graphik haus/ciphers
    - We want to do more science communication in general
    - Professionals for didactics
- Why am I telling you this?
  - Testbed for interesting crypto technologies
    - Looking at applying hacspec
    - Proof of work based DOS
    - Getting McEliece running on microcontrollers
    - Isolation technologies (virtualization, MicroVMs)
  - Translation research
    - Cooperations between industry and research
    - Just create an implementation
    - Talking to many orgs to figure out what to do
      - University departments cryptography
      - Other university departments
      - Politicians
      - Activists
      - Companies
    - Maybe that is useful for your projects?
- My intentions in the formosa space
  - Proof tool usability
  - Often written tools first and then
